## Download

Using docker is very easy, follow the instructions here:

## Running

Running using docker is also easy, see the script in this directory. It assumes
that there is a data set in /data/cellxgene that is mounted on /data into the
docker container.

## Data

Data is typically in an AnnData HD5 file. Example data sets can be found here:
